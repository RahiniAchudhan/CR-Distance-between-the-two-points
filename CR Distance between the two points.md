# CR Distance between two values
# AIM:
  To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points

# ALGORITHM:
## Step 1:
   Using import math function,do the calculations.

## Step 2:
   Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.

## Step 3:
   Substitute the values in the distance formula
   √((x_2-x_1)²+(y_2-y_1)²)

## Step 4:
   using the print function, display the distance between the two points.

## Step 5:
   End the program.  

# PROGRAM:
```
import math 
l1 = [4,2]
l2 = [10,6]
d = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print(f"{d:.2f}")
```

# OUTPUT:

# RESULT:
 The distance between the two points is sucessfully executed and displayed.
